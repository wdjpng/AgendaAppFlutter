# AgendaApp
The flutter application to manage events (thought for schools). 
Admins can send messages to user groups, users can create their own messages localy. Furthermore there are Webviews for cafeteria menues, contact sites or things like that. In a settings page users can sign in as admins and select their groups. 

This application is currently mobile but because it uses flutter, web or desktop applications could be created with the same code base.

## Prerequisites

To test the application you will need to install and setup [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install), [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).


## Installation

Firstly we will download the repository from GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/wdjpng/AgendaAppFlutter/
```
Then we will open the project in Android Studio
```
Click on Files ... Open and then select /path_to_your_files/AgendaAppFlutter
```

After the Application is built (```AgendaAppFlutter: syncing...``` is replaced with ```Project setup: synced successfully)```

## Running
After installing we can now [run the app](https://developer.android.com/studio/run). For this you will either need an emulator or a mobile device. 

Now you are ready to use the app and change it's code.
